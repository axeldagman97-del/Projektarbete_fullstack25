        <h1> COOKIES</h1>
            <p> Welcome to gramme, your new favorite cookie shop!
                <br> 
                <br> 

                We bake cookies for the cool kids (and guess what? everyone’s cool here!). Whether you find us online or catch us popping up around Stockholm, our mission is simple: to craft bold, flavor-packed cookies made with the best quality ingredients we can get our hands on.
            
                It all started back in 2020, when we, like many others, fell head over heels for baking: experimenting with doughs, textures, and flavors. From cakes and breads to all kinds of pastries, we eventually found our sweet spot: cookies. They’re fun, comforting, and endlessly creative, and that’s exactly what we love about them. The search for the ultimate cookie continues!
                At gramme, we believe in quality, taste, and community. These cookies are for everyone, whether you’re a foodie, a late-night snacker, or just someone who believes that life’s better with a cookie in hand.
                Thanks for being part of our journey! One gram(me) at a time. </p>
